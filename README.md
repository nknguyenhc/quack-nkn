Telegram bot for website tracking.

Have you ever wanted to track when a particular job opening will be open for application? Or when a particular information is out? Fret not! My Telegram bot sends you screenshots of those websites to you at the frequency you want, either everyday, every week, or once. My bot also has an accompanying reminder feature if you wish to reminder yourselves with tasks related to your website trackers.
